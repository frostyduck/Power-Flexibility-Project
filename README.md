# Power-Flexibility-Project
Some program codes for the RSF-DFG project "Development of Innovative Technologies and Tools for Flexibility Assessment and Enhancement of Future Power Systems"

## Bilevel_PowerSystem 

This folder consists of Python and Matlab program codes, which presents a bi-level optimization framework applied to study operating flexibility and optimize two-level power system performance with (1) increasing presence of distributed energy resources (DER) at the low-voltage level, and (2) variable wind power generation at the high-voltage level. 

**BilevelTest_Matlab** - the folder, which includes MATLAB program files for classical bilevel optimization approach. It requires Mathpower, YALMIP and Gurobi. 

**BilevelTest_Python** - the folder, which includes Python program files for classical bilevel optimization approach. It requires Pypower, Pyomo and Gurobi.

**BilevelRL_Python** - the folder, which includes Python program files for bilevel reinforcement learning approach.
